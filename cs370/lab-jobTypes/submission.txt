CPU bound (pi) times:
    real: 0m14.058s
    user: 0m13.989s
    sys:  0m0.057s
I/O bound (pi_io) times:
    real: 2m35.379s
    user: 0m24.448s
    sys:  1m5.440s

The CPU bound program, pi.c, executed faster than the
I/O bound program, pi_io.c, because the I/O operations
of my device are slower than the CPU operations
causing the I/O bound program to be slower do to the
hardware of the device.

A CPU bound program is a program where most of the time
is spent in the CPU, so the performance is based on the
CPU. An I/O bound program is a program where most of the
time is spent doing I/O operations, so the performance is
based on the speed of I/O.
