Without applications running:
-Memory Used: 968 megabytes
-Memory Shared: 34 megabytes
-Memory Buffered/cached: 760 megabytes

With application running:
-Memory Used: 2821 megabytes
-Memory Shared: 105 megabytes
-Memory Buffered/cached: 2425 megabytes

The more applications are running, the more memory is accessed so all of
the numbers for memory usage, sharing, and in the buffer/cache rise.
