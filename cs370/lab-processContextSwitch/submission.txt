Which program has mostly voluntary context switches and which has mostly nonvoluntary context 
switches and why?
cpu.c was only nonvoluntary context switches while cpu-print.c was a mix of both but still 
majority of nonvolitary context switches. cpu-print.c had voluntary context switches and more
nonvolitary context switches because it was getting blocked by I/O operations.

Which program uses more system time and why?
cpu-print.c also had more system time because it was performing I/O operations and cpu.c was not.
