Section 3 - Execution Results
A:
The typical time was 2,266,975 milliseconds.
For the CPU history: CPU1 was at 82.6%, CPU2 was at 67.6%, CPU3 was at 83.0%, and CPU4 was at 99.0%.
B:
The typical time was 3,785,550 milliseconds.
For the CPU history: CPU1 was at 98%, CPU2 was at 97.0%, CPU3 was at 97.0%, and CPU4 was at 100.0%.

Section 4 - Processor Affinity
Execution B was degraded because the priority schedule was less optimal than it was for Execution A.
Using a different priority schedule would be advantageous when you specifally need to do multiple tasks at once, such as when you need to process audio while running background tasks.
