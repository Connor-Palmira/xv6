The server program first creates a socket and then binds the socket to an IP address.
After doing so, it will wait for a client program to start running. When a client
program starts running, it will print the IP address of the client program and whenever
the user enters something into the client program, the server program will print a cow
saying what the user entered into the client program.

The client program first connects to the socket from the server program. Then, the client
program will ask for user input over and over until the user enters ":exit" to exit the
client program.

When creating a client program, it connects with an IP address of 0.0.0.0, but if a second
client program is created, it connects with an IP address of 127.0.0.1. The reason
the first client program is 0.0.0.0 is probably because it uses a virtual address and the
first avaiable slot was at 0. The TCP/IP port of the first client program was 0 while the second
client program/s was 56,284.

One advantage of using sockets is the connection between the server and the client can be used
for communication such as texting or social media.

One disadvantage of using sockets is that it needs a lot of resources to manage the server.
