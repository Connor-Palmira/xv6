memB takes about 5 times as longer as memA does in user time (45 seconds compared to 8).
However, memB takes around half as long in system time then memA does (4 seconds compared to 10).
Both memA and memB have around the same maximum resident set size, with memB having a slight increase.
Neither memA nor memB had any any major faults and they both had around 800,000 minor faults.
memA didn't have any voluntary context switches while memB had only 1.
Finally, memB had over 3 times as many involuntary context switches compared to memA (495 compared to 149).
